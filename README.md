# odin-restaurant

This project was done as part of TheOdinProject (https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-restaurant-page) and  uses Webpack to bundle files into a `dist` directory and deploys the contents of this directory to GitHub Pages using a dedicated `deploy` branch.

## Overview

The `dist` folder, generated by Webpack, contains the static files that are to be served by GitHub Pages. To keep the main branch clean and avoid tracking build artifacts, we use a `deploy` branch to handle deployment.

## Project structure

### 1. Main branch

1. **The main branch has the development related code**
    The dist folder is added to gitignore. You can build the dist code locally using 
   ```bash
      npx webpack
2. **The Deploy branch has the deployement ready code**
    This is an orphaned branch. Only the deployement ready code is commited and tracked here.  
    You can deploy into gh-pages from this branch using 
   ```bash
    git subtree push --prefix dist origin gh-pages
